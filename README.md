Apple-ID-Creator-Universal
==========================

Universal Yosemite and iTunes 12.0

This a major rewrite of the original Apple ID creator script. To use it, set the country code in the top of the script. You can also customise it by just setting a single customisation and deleting the ones you don't need. 
I know that this script doesn't follow best practice as it declares a lot of global variables at the top rather than keeping them inside the functions, but it was the easiest way to make it understandable and configurable by non-coders.
Due the large amount of work by myself and others on these routines, I have decided to make this script "donation ware". If you are creating a large number of Apple ID's, I know the amount of time it can save you.
If you are a regular user, could you please show your appreciation of the amount of work that has gone into this by making a donation to a charity of your choice.
This version varies from the Mavericks version due to the way the different OS's report the position of graphics elements the script uses to confirm the correct pages are open (Why Apple?)
Changes to the script are noted at the bottom.

You use this script at your own risk. There are no warranties, direct or implied. Support will be available if possible through the EnterpriseIOS web forum.
